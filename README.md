### Application to manage triage in a hospital

# Description

### 1. It is planned to create a manager for the triage area of a hospital, which classifies patients by priority and waiting time, so that they are attended in the shortest time. The following endpoints are proposed for the backend: 

##     POST / patient
    a. A patient is registered and assigned a priority (Metadata automatically) 
##     GET /patient 
    b. Get all patients in whitelist ordered by asc createdAt 
##     PUT/ patient
    c. Update the data of a patient registred when the info haved a error.
##     DELETE/ patient
    d. Delete a patient of the whitelist when they have already been treated.


### 2.  To assign the priority of a patient, the following items are taken into account:
      
      - 1: Resuscitation
      - 2: Emergency
      - 3: Urgency
      - 4: Minor Urgency
      - 5: No Urgency

### Tech stack: 
    - NodeJS 
    - Mysql 
    - Express
    - Migrations (Knex)
    - Test 1 Endpoint (JEST)
    - CI (GitHub)
    - Dockerfile
